    <p>We can optimize a solution using both time and space optimization. To optimize a program,</p>
    
    <ol>
		<li>We can reduce the time taken to run the program and increase the space occupied
</li>
		<li>We can reduce the memory usage of the program and increase it's total run time
</li>
		<li>We can reduce both time and space complexity by deploying relevant algorithms
</li>
